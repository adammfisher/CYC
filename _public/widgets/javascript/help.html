<h3>Javascript Widget</h3>
<p>
  The Javascript Widget is ideal for embedding D3.js or other Javascript libraries
  into Cyclotron.  It provides an empty &lt;DIV&gt; element, positioned and sized with the 
  rest of the dashboard, and invokes custom Javascript code.  A Data Source can be used
  with it, and the loaded data will be passed into the Javascript function.
  
</p>
<p>
  It overlaps in its ability slightly with the HTML Widget, but as its name implies,
  the Javascript Widget is best suited for making Javascript-heavy custom Widgets.  In 
  the event that the HTML Widget is not flexible enough to generate the desired output,
  the Javascript Widget can be used to dynamically create the HTML elements and add them
  to the page.
  
</p>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>
  These are the properties specific to this widget.  
  General Cyclotron widget properties are not repeated here (e.g. layout properties).
  
</p>
<property-table properties="config.widgets.javascript.properties"></property-table>
<h4>Javascript Function</h4>
<p>The only required property, <em>functionName</em>, must point to a Javascript function defined in the Scripts section of the Dashboard.  The 
  script can either be specified inline, or included from an external script.  Either way, the
  scripts will be loaded while the Dashboard is rendering, before the Widget is initialized.
  The best practice is to attach the function to the <em>Cyclotron </em>or <em>Cyclotron.user </em>object to avoid name collisions.
</p>
<p>
  The function takes one argument: the actual Widget object.  This allows a reusable Javascript Widget
  function to be created, since parameters can be passed in the Widget definition.  The UI editor
  doesn't provide a way to edit such parameters currently, so they must be specified directly in the 
  JSON Editor.
  
</p>
<p>
  The function must return a Javascript hash, with key/values as event handlers.  They are all optional,
  depending on whether or not the event needs to be handled.  Cyclotron will invoke the <em>functionName </em>and save the returned hash.  This allows multiple copies of the same Javascript Widget function on a 
  single Dashboard, since each one is a separate instance.

    <td>Invoked whenever the Widget dimensions change.  It is throttled slightly to avoid overcalling.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>onData</td>
    <td>element, data</td>
    <td>
      If a Data Source is provided, this function will be invoked whenever it changes.  
      This includes the initial load, as well as updates if the Data Source has a <em>refresh </em>configured.  It is also invoked if the Widget's own <em>refresh </em>property is configured, and no <em>onRefresh </em>function is provided.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>onRefresh</td>
    <td>element, data</td>
    <td>If the Javascript Widget's <em>refresh </em>property is set, this method will be invoked at the defined interval.  If this 
      method is not defined, <em>onData </em>will be invoked instead.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  As mentioned before, none of these events are required, and will be ignored if not provided.  There
  are usually several ways to achieve the same functionality.  For example, it's generally easier
  to clear and start over rather than resize existing HTML elements; the same may apply when loading 
  new data.  Both the <em>onData </em>and <em>onResize </em>properties can point to a common method defined at the top of the function, which does exactly that.
  While easier to code, it may suffer from flicker or slow performance.
</p>
<p>Here is a template for the function:</p>
<pre class="code">Cyclotron.myJavascriptWidget = function(widget) {

    // Widget variables
    // Common methods
    
    return {
        onCreate: function (element) {
            // initialization
            // create HTML
        },

        onResize: function(element, data) {
            // resize or update the layout
        },

        onData: function(element, data) {
            // do something with data
        }
    }
};


</pre>
