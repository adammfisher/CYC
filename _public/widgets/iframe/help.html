<h3>iframe Widget</h3>
<p>
  The iframe Widget embeds a web site inside a Cyclotron dashboard.  It uses an iframe tag (hence the name), 
  so the target website is loaded completely within the confines of the widget.
  
</p>
<p>
  Please note that currently, Cyclotron does not have the ability to provide authentication to the website.  
  Pages requiring a login (e.g. Jira) can be used, but they will only work correctly if the browser viewing 
  the dashboard has logged into the website.  Otherwise, the widget will most likely show a login screen.
  
</p>
<p>By default, iframe widgets will have scroll bars if their content is too large for the widget size.  This can be suppressed by setting the <em>noscroll </em>property to true.</p>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>
  These are the properties specific to this widget.  
  General Cyclotron widget properties are not repeated here (e.g. layout properties).

<property-table properties="config.widgets.iframe.properties"></property-table>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>Basic Usage</h4>
<p>This is the minimum set of properties needed for this widget.</p>
<pre class="code">"widgets": [{
    "url": "http://www.expedia.com",
    "widget": "iframe"
}]

</pre>
<h4>Fullscreen iframe</h4>
<p>
  This dashboard has a single row/column, which is filled with the iframe.  The page margin and widget padding is removed 
  with style: "fullscreen", which gives the illusion that the target site is loaded directly.
