<h3>Stoplight Widget</h3>
<p>
  The Stoplight Widget displays an image of a traffic light with 3 lights, one of which can be
  illuminated at a time.  Which light will be lit is determined by three rule expressions, one for each
  color.  The Widget can optionally take a Data Source: if provided, the first row of the Data Source will
  be available to the rule expressions for variable replacement.  The rules are short-circuiting, and execute
  in the order red-yellow-green.  The first rule that returns true will be illuminated, while the other lights
  go dark.
  
</p>
<p>
  When using a Data Source, only the first row of the result set will be used.  Ideally, the data 
  source would only return one row, but the <em>filters/sortBy </em>properties can be used to manipulate the result, removing unwanted rows and ordering the correct row 
  at the front (ascending).  For example, if a Data Source returns daily data for the past month, sorting 
  by "-date" would order by date descending, causing the row with the most recent data to appear first.

<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>
  These are the properties specific to this widget.  
  General Cyclotron widget properties are not repeated here (e.g. layout properties).

<property-table properties="config.widgets.stoplight.properties"></property-table>
<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>These are the properties inside the <em>rules  </em>property.  They support inline Javascript and variable replacement from the Data Source, if provided. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>Hard-coded Stoplight</h4>
<p>This widget always displays a red light.</p>
<p>This example is available on the <a href="/example-stoplight">example-stoplight</a> dashboard</p>
<pre class="code">{
    "rules": {
        "red": "${true}"
    },
    "widget": "stoplight"
}
</pre>
<h4>Stoplight with Title</h4>
<p>A title is shown above this stoplight.</p>
<p>This example is available on the <a href="/example-stoplight">example-stoplight</a> dashboard</p>
<pre class="code">{
    "rules": {
        "green": "${true}",
        "yellow": "${false}",
        "red": "${false}"
    },
    "title": "Stoplight with Title",
    "widget": "stoplight"
}
</pre>
<h4>Random Stoplight</h4>
<p>
  This widget uses the Mock Data Source to generate random numbers.  The rule expressions for each light
  evaluate one of the columns in the Data Source and toggle the color accordingly.  Since Green is evaluated
  last, it can be set to "${true}" to ensure it catches all other cases.
