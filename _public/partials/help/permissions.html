<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>
  Cyclotron has integration with LDAP or Active Directory for user authentication.
  Users can login with their domain username/password.  Sessions are kept active by using Cyclotron, 
  but will periodically expire for security reasons.
  
</p>
<p>
  Dashboards are unsecured by default, but can optionally be secured to a list of Editors and/or Viewers.  
  These are both optional, and if omitted, allow everyone to edit and view, respectively.  
  Viewing of Dashboards cannot be restricted unless editing has also been restricted.
  
</p>
<h4>Permission model</h4>
<p>
  Both Editor and Viewer permissions are based on LDAP/Active Directory Users and/or Groups.  In both cases, one or more Users and/or Groups can be added to the 
  Dashboard, restricting permissions to the specific Users listed, or Users that are members of the specific Groups listed.  Nested Groups are not supported!
</p>
<p>There are several types of Groups: Security Groups, Distribution Lists, Groups.  Any of them can be used interchangeably in Cyclotron.</p>
<h4>Edit Permissions</h4>
<p>
  Creating and Editing Dashboards requires the current user to be logged in.  This is for audit purposes and tracking who made which Dashboard changes.
  By default, Dashboards can be edited by any logged-in user.  This refers specifically to saving changes to a Dashboard, not merely viewing the Dashboard
  definition in the Editor (which falls under View Permissions)
</p>
<p>Editing can be restricted by adding one or more<strong> Editors</strong> to the<em> Edit Permissions</em> box on the Details page of the Dashboard Editor.  Auto-complete is enabled after typing three characters.</p>
<h4>View Permissions</h4>
<p>
  View Permissions covers the ability to see a Dashboard, including viewing the Dashboard definition, exporting the Dashboard, etc.  By default, all users 
  have view permission for all Dashboards, even if they cannot edit the Dashboards.
</p>
<p>Viewing can be restricted by adding one or more<strong> Viewers</strong> to the<em> View Permissions</em> box on the Details page of the Dashboard Editor.  Auto-complete is enabled after typing three characters.</p>
<p>Anyone with <em> Edit Permissions</em> automatically inherits <em> View Permissions</em>.  Note that this means<em> View Permissions</em> are ignored unless<em> Edit Permissions</em> are set, as everyone can edit by default, and thus everyone can view as well.</p>

<h4>REST API</h4>
<p>
  The REST API implements the same permission model as the UI, 
  requiring login and session keys on all endpoints requiring authentication.
