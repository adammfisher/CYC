<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>
  Cyclotron provides several Data Source Types, each of which connects to an external service to 
  pull in data for the Dashboard. Data Sources and Widgets consume a common row/column interface, so Widgets and Data Sources are interchangeable. Each Data Source handles converting data into this format automatically.
  
</p>
<p>
  Data Sources use a simple tabular data format, consisting of an array of rows. Each row is a JavaScript object, where the keys represent columns and the values represent the value of each column.  Here's an example:
  
</p>
<pre class="code">[
    { "row": 1, "value": 5, "letter": "a" },
    { "row": 2, "value": 4, "letter": "b" },
    { "row": 3, "value": 3, "letter": "c" },
    { "row": 4, "value": 2, "letter": "d" },
    { "row": 5, "value": 1, "letter": "e" }
]
</pre>
<p>Cyclotron is case-sensitive, which is especially significant when working with Data Sources.  When referencing column names in the Data Source, the correct capitalization must be used to match the upstream source.  Cyclotron itself does not modify the original capitalization of columns.</p>
<p>
  The easiest way to verify that a Data Source is working is to use the Table Widget.  By default, the Table Widget will display all columns and rows, so it can be used to quickly view and verify the data available from a Data Source. Be aware that the Table Widget will automatically camel-case the column headers, but the correct capitalization must be used elsewhere to reference the columns.
  
</p>
<h4>Common Properties</h4>
<p>
  These properties are common to all Data Sources.  Each Data Source type has additional properties 
  that are specific to that type.
</p>
<property-table properties="config.dashboard.properties.dataSources.properties"></property-table>
<p>Both properties <em>filters </em>and <em>sortBy </em>can also be placed on Data Sources and/or Widgets.  So a shared Data Source can have one set of filters, and it can be consumed by two Widgets, each
  of which have their own unique filters, which are applied after the common filter.
</p>
<h4>Auto-Refresh</h4>
<p>
  By default, Data Sources run only once and send data to dependent Widgets.  However, all 
  Data Source types have the ability to automatically refresh their data periodically,
  updating the Widgets as well.  The<em> refresh</em> property configures the refresh rate&mdash;it gives
  the number of seconds between each refresh.
</p>
<h4>Filters</h4>
<p>Examples of Filters and Sorting are available on the <a href="/example-filters-sort">example-filters-sort</a> dashboard</p>
<p>
  Filters are used to remove rows from a Data Source, implemented as a hash of key/value pairs.  
  Here's an example which matches only rows of type "Independent State":
</p>
<pre class="code">"filters": {
    "Type": "Independent State"
}
</pre>
<p>If multiple Filters are set, all of them must be true for a row to be included:</p>
<pre class="code">"filters": {
    "Sub Type": "Territory",
    "Type": "Dependency"
}
</pre>
<p>Each Filter value can also be an array of multiple values.  In this scenario, a row will match if the given column has any of the values in the array.  </p>
<p class="bg-warning"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i><span>The GUI Editor cannot edit Filter arrays; this must be done in the JSON editor.</span></p>
<pre class="code">"filters": {
    "Type": ["Disputed Territory", "Antarctic Territory"]
}
</pre>
<p>Filters also support wildcards and regular expressions.  A wildcard ("*") matches any non-null, non-empty values.</p>
<pre class="code">"filters": {
    "Capital": "*",
    "Type": "Dependency"
}
</pre>
<p>Use slashes to indicate a regular expression:</p>
<pre class="code">"filters": {
    "Sub Type": "/.*Territory/",
    "Type": "Dependency"
} 
</pre>
<h4>Sorting</h4>
<p>Examples of Filters and Sorting are available on the <a href="/example-filters-sort">example-filters-sort</a> dashboard</p>
<p>
  After rows have been filtered, they can be sorted by one or more columns (or functions).  
  This simple example sorts by the "Type" column, in ascending order:
</p>
<pre class="code">"sortBy": "Type"
</pre>
<p>Multiple columns can be combined in an array.  The sort order can be flipped by placing a minus ("-") symbol at the beginning of the string, before the column name.</p>
<pre class="code">"sortBy": ["Type", "Sub Type", "-ISO 3166-1 Number"]
</pre>
<p>Javascript functions can be used to define more complicated sort logic, and used instead of a column name.  Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="code">"sortBy": ["${Cyclotron.customSortFunction}", "Common Name"]
</pre>
<p>And the custom sort function (defined as a Script):</p>
<pre class="code">Cyclotron.customSortFunction = function(r1, r2, defaultSort) {
    if (r1['Common Name'] == 'United States') {
        return -1;
    } else if (r2['Common Name'] == 'United States') {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The first two parameters are two rows, and the return value indicates which of the two rows comes first, following the definition of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">Array.sort</a> in Javascript.</p>
<p>The last parameter is a reference to the default sort function, which has built-in support for numbers, strings, etc.  Here's a trivial example of using it to sort by value:</p>
<pre class="code">"sortBy": ["${Cyclotron.customSortFunction}"]</pre>
<pre class="code">Cyclotron.customSortFunction = function (r1, r2, defaultSort) {
    return defaultSort(r1.value, r2.value);
};
</pre>
<p>This is identical to the following, shorter version:</p>
<pre class="code">"sortBy": "value"
</pre>
<p>Additionally, the <em>postProcessor </em> property of some Data Sources can be used to implement custom sort logic in Javascript, if the default alphanumerical sort is not sufficient.</p>
<h4>Pre-Processor</h4>
<p>
  All Data Sources support an optional pre-processor function that will be called immediately before each
  execution of the Data Source.  The pre-processor can view or modify the Data Source properties, which are
  passed into the function as an argument.  Any changes to the Data Source are transient and will not persist beyond
  the execution immediately following.
</p>
<h4>Post-Processors</h4>
<p>
  Most Data Sources support an optional post-processor function that will be called after
  data is loaded, and optionally filtered and/or sorted.  The post-processor can either 
  modify the original result object, or it can return a non-null array to replace it.  
  The Post-Processor function is invoked for each Result Set (if the Data Source returns multiple Result Sets), 
  and the Result Set name is passed as the second argument.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a post-processor that modifies the data set:</p>
<pre class="code">function(dataSet, resultSetName) { 
    _.each(dataSet, function(row) { 
        row.col1 += 1000;
    }); 
}
</pre>
<p>Here is an example of a post-processor that returns a new data set:</p>
<pre class="code">function(dataSet, resultSetName) { 
    return _.map(dataSet, function(row) { 
        return { newCol: row.col1 + 1000 }; 
    }); 
}
</pre>
<p>
  Post-Processors can also perform side effects, such as updating global JavaScript variables, or executing functions. 
  Since they are triggered by the completion of a Data Source, they are the most-reliable method of running some
  JavaScript after the Data Source has finished loading.
</p>
<pre class="code">function(dataSet) {
    Cyclotron.customFunction(dataSet);
}
</pre>
