<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>Before you start building a Dashboard with Cyclotron, make sure you know two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What data do you want to display, and is it available?</li>
  <li>How do you want to visualize it?</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Knowing the answer to these questions will make it easier to get started with Cyclotron and avoid
  unnecessary effort.  It's also recommended to review the<a href="/?q=cyclotron-examples"> Example Dashboards</a>, to get a idea of what Cyclotron's capabilities are.
</p>
<h4>Creating a Dashboard</h4>
<p ng-if="config.authentication.enable">Before creating a Dashboard, you must login.  Click on the<strong> Login</strong> button on the home page, or on the top-right of the header.  After logging in, 
  the header will show the login status, and display your<a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank"> Gravatar</a> image (if configured).
</p>
<p>Click on the<strong> New Dashboard</strong> button on the home page, or on the top-right of the header.  The Dashboard Editor 
  will open with an empty configuration.
</p>
<h5>Name </h5>
<div class="bg-warning"><i class="fa fa-warning"> </i>
  <div class="inner"><span>Dashboards cannot be renamed after they have been created.  Choose a name wisely.</span></div>
</div>
<p>Enter a name for the dashboard in the <em> Name</em> textbox.  This name will be used in the URL to access the Dashboard. The name must be
  unique and alphanumeric&mdash;special characters are not allowed, and spaces will be 
  converted automatically into dashes.
</p>
<h5>Tags</h5>
<p>
   
  Tags are keywords used to organize and search for Dashboards.  For example, example Cyclotron
  dashboards are all tagged with <strong> cyclotron-examples</strong> so they can be easily discovered.  In the <em> Tags</em> box, select one or more existing Tags, or enter a new Tag.  This step is optional, and 
  more tags can be added or removed later.
</p>
<div ng-if="config.authentication.enable">
  <h5>Edit Permissions and View Permissions</h5>
  <p>
    By default, Cyclotron dashboards are open to everyone for viewing and editing.  These two 
    properties provide the means to restrict editing or viewing to specific user(s) and group(s).  
    For more information, see the help section <strong> Permissions</strong>.
  </p>
</div>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>The<em> description</em> property is an optional note displayed in search results and at the top of the Dashboard editor.</p>
<h5>Theme</h5>
<p>
  Several predefined themes are available, which change the color and styling of the 
  Dashboard and Widgets.  If left unset, Cyclotron will use the default theme<strong> ({{ config.dashboard.properties.theme.default }})</strong>. Pages and Widgets can override the 
  Dashboard theme, but will inherit this property by default.
</p>
<h5>Additional Properties</h5>
<p>
   
  Cyclotron has many optional properties, so the<em> Additional Properties</em> dropdown contains those less-frequently needed.  Selecting any of the properties in this
  dropdown adds to the Dashboard so it can be configured.
</p>
<h4>Saving the Dashboard</h4>
<p>At this point, click the green <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Save</strong> button at the top of the page.  This will create the first revision of the new Dashboard.  At
  this point, the Dashboard is available for anyone to view.  Click the blue <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Preview</strong> button to open the Dashboard in a new window.
</p>
<h5>Revisions</h5>
<p>
  Each time the Dashboard is modified and saved, the Revision number increments.  This is displayed 
  at the top of the Dashboard Editor. A copy of the Dashboard is saved as well, so older Revisions
  can be viewed or restored.  To view older Revisions, click on the<strong> Revision number</strong> link at the top of the Dashboard Editor.  This enables scrolling backward/forward through the
  Revision history.  The <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Preview</strong> button will preview the currently selected Revision as well.
</p>
<p>
  To restore an older Revision, scroll backwards in the history to select the correct Revision, then
  click <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Save</strong>. This will save a copy of the older Revision as a newer Revision, and increment the Revision number.
</p>
<h4>Viewing the Dashboard</h4>
<p>The Dashboard can be viewed in several ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Searching for the Dashboard by name or Tags, and selecting the Dashboard</li>
  <li>Clicking the <strong class="no-wrap"> <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Preview</strong> link in the Dashboard Editor</li>
  <li>Directly navigating to the Dashboard URL</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Dashboard navigation controls are available by hovering the mouse over the bottom center of the screen.
  If a Dashboard has more than one page, pages can be scrolled through using the<strong> left</strong> and<strong> right</strong> arrow buttons.
</p>
<div class="bg-info"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"> </i>
  <div class="inner"><span> The Dashboard can be saved and previewed at any time during development, and as frequently as needed.</span></div>
</div>
<h4>Adding a Data Source</h4>
<p>
  Before the Dashboard will display anything, it needs to load some data via 
  a Data Source.  Open the Dashboard Editor and click on <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> Data Sources</strong> in the sidebar.
</p>
<p>This page lists all the Data Sources in the Dashboard. Click <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add Data Source</strong> to create a new, empty Data Source.  The Data Source type and name
  will be shown in the list on this page.  The sidebar also lists each Data Source for 
  rapid navigation.
</p>
<p>
  Data Sources can also be cloned or removed, and moved up
  and down.  The order of Data Sources does not have any
  effect on the Dashboard and is cosmetic only.
</p>
<p>To edit the new Data Source, click on its name, or select it in the sidebar menu.</p>
<h5>Type</h5>
<p>
   
  The<em> type</em> property has a dropdown with all supported Data Source types.  Changing the 
  selected type will change what properties are available in the editor.  Select the<strong> json</strong> Data Source type, which is used to load JSON documents.
</p>
<p>The<em> url</em> property is required, and specifies the web location to download; it can be a static 
  file or a web service.  Here's a sample JSON file: <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=4yCbDza4" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=4yCbDza4</a>
</p>
<p>
  This sample JSON file can be used without any other configuration, as it is already
  in the correct format and does not require authentication.  Enter this URL in the<em> url</em> property.
</p>
<h5>Name</h5>
<p>
   
  The name is used by Widgets to reference this Data Source, so it should be a 
  unique, meaningful name.
</p>
<h5>Data Source Configuration</h5>
<p>
  The remaining configuration will be largely specific to which Data Source type is
  selected.  For more information on Data Sources, refer to the help section on <strong> Data Sources</strong>
</p>
<h4>Adding a Page</h4>
<p>
  After the Data Source is added, a new Page must be added to display the data.  In the 
  Dashboard Editor, click on <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-file-o"></i> Pages</strong> in the sidebar.
</p>
<p>This page lists all the Pages in the Dashboard. Click <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add Page</strong> to create a new, empty Page.  The Page name and list of widgets
  will be shown in the list on this page.  The sidebar also lists each Page for 
  rapid navigation.
</p>
<p>
  Pages can also be cloned or removed, and moved up
  and down.  The order of Pages determines the order they are displayed when
  viewing the Dashboard.
</p>
<p>To edit the new Page, click on its name, or select it in the sidebar menu.</p>
<h5>Name</h5>
<p>
  The name is displayed in URL when viewing this page.  It is optional&mdash;a default name
  will be generated from the page number if omitted.
</p>
<h5>Layout</h5>
<p>
  The Page Layout is important for determining how Widgets appear on the Dashboard.  Cyclotron
  uses a grid-based layout, so each page has a configurable number of rows and columns.  
  Widgets can span one or more rows/columns, and thesize of each row and column will be 
  adjusted to fit in the browser. 
</p>
<p>The Page Layour defaults to a<strong> 2x2</strong> grid, which can contain 4 1x1-sized Widgets.  Change<em> Grid Columns</em> to 1, and<em> Grid rows</em> to 1 as well.  This will fit a single Widget.</p>
<h5>Widgets</h5>
<p>By default, the Page has no Widgets on it.  Click the blue <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add Widget</strong> to create a new Widget on this page.  The Widget type (and title) will be shown in 
  the list on this page.  The sidebar also lists each Widget in the current Page for 
  rapid navigation.
</p>
<p>To edit the new Widget, click on its name, or select it in the sidebar menu.</p>
<h4>Adding a Widget</h4>
<h5>Type</h5>
<p>
  Each Widget on the Dashboard must be one of several supported Widget Types. By default, 
  a Widget has no Type.  In the Widget Type dropdown, select<strong> Table</strong>.  Changing the 
  selected Widget Type will change what properties are available in the editor.
</p>
<p><strong>Table</strong> is a good Widget to begin with, because its default behavior is to show all
  the rows and columns of the Data Source, without needing any configuration. 
</p>
<h5>Data Source</h5>
<p>To reference the Data Source created earlier, select the Data Source name from the<em> Data Source</em> property dropdown.  This connects the Widget to the results from the Data Source.</p>
<h5>Layout</h5>
<p>
  Each Widget has a layout configuration, which is used in conjection with the Page
  Layout to determine the size of the Widget.  The default Widget size is 1x1.
  Since the Page Layout is set to<strong> 1x1</strong>, set this Widget to<strong> 1x1</strong> to match (or leave it unset to use the default).
</p>
<h5>Save and Preview Dashboard</h5>
<p>
  At this point, the Dashboard should have a Data Source and a connected Table Widget. 
  Save and Preview the Dashboard now, to see the result.
</p>
<h4>Continuing Development</h4>
<p>
  This was a basic introduction to creating a very simple Dashboard.  From here, more Data
  Sources or Widgets can be added and configured.
</p>
