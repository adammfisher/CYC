<h3>Layout</h3>
<h4>Grid Layout</h4>
<p>
  The primary layout scheme for Dashboards is a grid layout.  This means that a Dashboard page is divided into a fixed
  number of rows and columns, which automatically scale up and down with the browser resolution.  Widgets are given a 
  corresponding number of rows and columns, and they are resized accordingly to match the grid.  In general, this allows 
  the Dashboard to be viewed at different browser resolutions and aspect ratios.  
  
</p>
<h5>Widgets</h5>
<p>Each Widget in the Dashboard can be assigned a<em> gridHeight</em> and <em> gridWidth</em>, which correspond to the number of rows and columns that the Widget spans.  
  For example, a 2x2 Page can fit four 1x1 Widgets.  But it could also 
  fit one 2x1 and two 1x1 Widgets.  It's possible to split rows and columns&mdash;e.g. <em>gridWidth</em> of 1.5 to span one and a half columns.  Care must be taken to ensure the Widgets align as expected.
</p>
<p>Widgets are sized according to their <em>gridHeight </em>and <em>gridWidth </em>properties, then the <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a> library is used to push the Widgets together.  The order of the Widgets in the Dashboard matters, in that Masonry 
  will not rearrange the Widgets to fit, but rather it only removes empty vertical space.  The Widgets are placed in order from the top left, 
  wrapping as needed based on the number of columns.
</p>
<h5>Mobile Devices</h5>
<p>
  Special consideration is given to mobile devices in landscape or portrait mode.  This overrides the normal grid settings
  with either a 2x1 or 1x2 layout.  Widgets are also overridden to display in a 1x1 resolution.
  
</p>
<h5>Scrolling Dashboards</h5>
<p>
  It's possible to provide more Widgets than will fit on the screen at once.  Dashboards can be scrolled to view additional 
  widgets.  The Grid Layout can still be used if the Page is longer than the browser&mdash;the Grid Height remains fixed 
  to the browser height.  However unless a Dashboard is designed for full-screen use, it may be desirable to specify fixed 
  heights for Widgets.  See the section on <strong>Absolute Layout</strong> below for more information.
</p>
<p>If needed, the ability to vertically scroll a Page can be forcibly disabled by setting the<em> scrolling</em> property to "false" in the Page's layout section.  However this should not be needed if the Widgets on a Page do not
   extend below the bottom of the browser.
</p>
<p>The default settings are for Pages to be 2x2 and Widgets to be 1x1.</p>
<p>Here is a JSON example:</p>
<pre class="code">{
   "name": "myDashboard",
   "theme": "dark",
   "pages": [
        {
            "layout": {
                "gridColumns": 3,
                "gridRows": 2,
                "gutter": 40
            },
            "widgets": [{
                    "gridHeight": 1,
                    "gridWidth": 1,
                    "widget": "clock"
                }, {
                    "gridHeight": 2,
                    "gridWidth": 2,
                    "widget": "table"
                },
                {
                    "gridHeight": 1,
                    "gridWidth": 1,
                    "widget": "clock"
                }
            ]
        }
   ]
}</pre>
<p>
   
  The example above hardcodes the dashboard to have three columns and two rows. The Widgets each specify a
  gridWidth and gridHeight, which fits them neatly into the grid.  The default gutter size was also increased.
</p>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<property-table properties="config.dashboard.properties.pages.properties.layout.properties"></property-table>
<h4>Absolute Layout</h4>
<p>It is also possible to define absolute sizes for all or some Widgets.  The Widgets have <em>height </em>and <em>width </em>properties which take CSS-compatible dimensions, e.g. "20%", "200px", "5rem".  
  This may be useful for displaying fixed-height or non-scalable content, however this prevents
  Widgets from automatically scaling with the Dashboard.
</p>
<p>
  Absolute sizing can be combined with the Grid Layout by defining only one property of each.  For example,
  setting the <em> height</em> property and the <em> gridWidth</em> property together will create a fixed-height but fluid-width Widget.
</p>
<h5>Combining Absolutely-Sized Widgets with Grid Layout</h5>
<p>It's possible to mix Widgets with absolute sizes in a grid layout, by using the <em> gridWidthAdjustment</em> and/or<em> gridHeightAdjustment</em> properties.  These can be set to negative values to indicate the number of pixels to remove from the page height or width before calculating the grid sizes.</p>
<p>For example, to add a 150px header onto a dashboard with a 10px gutter, the <em> gridHeightAdjustment</em> would be set to -160.  Then the remaining Widgets would be sized-to-fit as if the page height was actually 160 pixels shorter. </p>
