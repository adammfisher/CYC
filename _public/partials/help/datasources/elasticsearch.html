<h3>Elasticsearch Data Source</h3>
<p>The Elasticsearch Data Source is a thin wrapper around the Elasticsearch API, making it easier to submit searches and process the results. For more fine-tuned control around the requests, it may be preferable to use the JSON Data Source instead.</p>
<P>Please note that it may be necessary to set the optional <em>proxy </em>property in the Data Source in order to access web sites or services in other domains.  
  This property lists other Cyclotron servers which may have the required connectivity. 
  By default, this Data Source uses the current Cyclotron environment to proxy the request.
</P>
<p>Examples of the Elasticsearch Data Source are available on the <a href="/example-datasource-elasticsearch">example-datasource-elasticsearch</a> dashboard</p>

<h4>API Name</h4>
<p>The <em> method</em> property (displayed as API Name) controls which Elasticsearch endpoint to submit the request to.  By default this is "_search", but it can by changed to any valid endpoint (e.g. "_msearch", "_suggest").</p>
<h4>Response Adapter</h4>
<p>The <em> responseAdapter</em> property controls how Cyclotron handles the result that Elasticsearch provides.  The default value, <em> "auto"</em>, automatically selects between <em> "hits"</em> and <em> "aggregations"</em> by choosing <em> "aggregations"</em> when the response includes aggregations, otherwise<em> "hits</em>. Both <em> "hits"</em> and <em> "aggregations"</em> can be selected manually as well.  If a Elasticsearch request returns both hits and aggregations, custom processing will be needed to consume both at once.  This is possible using the <em> "raw" </em> option, which returns the original response.  In this case, the <em> postProcessor</em> option should be set to a JavaScript function that can handle the entire result.</p>
<h4>Pre-Processor</h4>
<p>
  The Elasticsearch Data Source supports an optional pre-processor function that will be called before
  the Data Source executes.  For more details, see the main Data Sources page.
</p>
<h4>Post-Processor</h4>
<p>
  The Elasticsearch Data Source supports an optional post-processor function that will be called after
  data is loaded.  For more details, see the main Data Sources page.
</p>
<p>The data that is sent to the Post-Processor will depend on the setting of the <em> responseAdapter</em> property. This property controls how the Elasticsearch response is converted into Cyclotron's tabular data format. The Post-Processor receives the output of whichever <em> responseAdapter</em> has been selected.  In order to manually inspect the entire response, set <em> responseAdapter</em> to "raw".</p>
