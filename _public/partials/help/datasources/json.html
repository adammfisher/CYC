<h3>JSON Data Source</h3>
<p>
  The JSON Data Source simply loads JSON data from a web URL.  Cyclotron implements a reverse-proxy to
  avoid cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues.  Under the covers it uses the <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/request" target="_blank">Request library</a>, and the full list of options can be set in Cyclotron for more advanced requests.  
</p>
<P>Please note that it may be necessary to set the optional <em>proxy </em>property in the Data Source in order to access web sites or services in other domains.  
  This property lists other Cyclotron servers which may have the required connectivity. 
  By default, this Data Source uses the current Cyclotron environment to proxy the request.

<p>Examples of the JSON Data Source are available on the <a href="/example-datasource-json">example-datasource-json</a> dashboard</p>

<h4>Pre-Processor</h4>
<p>
  The JSON Data Source supports an optional pre-processor function that will be called before
  the Data Source executes.  For more details, see the main Data Sources page.
</p>
<h4>Post-Processor</h4>
<p>
  The JSON Data Source supports an optional post-processor function that will be called after
  data is loaded.  For more details, see the main Data Sources page.
