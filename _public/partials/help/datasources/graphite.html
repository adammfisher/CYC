<h3>Graphite Data Source</h3>
<p>
  The Graphite Data Source connects to any Graphite server and uses the /render API to extract raw values.
  It can output one or more targets, which can use the full list of <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/functions.html" target="_blank">Graphite functions</a>.
</p>
<P>Please note that it may be necessary to set the optional <em>proxy </em>property in the Data Source in order to access web sites or services in other domains.  
  This property lists other Cyclotron servers which may have the required connectivity. 
  By default, this Data Source uses the current Cyclotron environment to proxy the request.

<p>Examples of the Graphite Data Source are available on the <a href="/example-datasource-graphite">example-datasource-graphite</a> dashboard</p>
