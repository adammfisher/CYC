<h3>InfluxDB Data Source</h3>
<p> <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb" target="_blank">InfluxDB </a> is an open source time series database built from the ground up to handle high write and query loads.
   This Data Source supports querying InfluxDB for metrics using <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/spec/" target="_blank">InfluxQL.</a>
</p>
<P>Please note that it may be necessary to set the optional <em>proxy </em>property in the Data Source in order to access web sites or services in other domains.  
  This property lists other Cyclotron servers which may have the required connectivity. 
  By default, this Data Source uses the current Cyclotron environment to proxy the request.
