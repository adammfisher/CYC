<h3>CloudWatch Data Source</h3>
<p>The CloudWatch Data Source is a thin wrapper around the Amazon CloudWatch API, making it easier to submit queries and retrieve the results. For more fine-tuned control around the requests, it may be preferable to use the JSON Data Source instead.</p>
<P>Please note that it may be necessary to set the optional <em>proxy </em>property in the Data Source in order to access web sites or services in other domains.  
  This property lists other Cyclotron servers which may have the required connectivity. 
  By default, this Data Source uses the current Cyclotron environment to proxy the request.

<h4>AWS Endpoint</h4>
<p>Amazon Web Services offer various regional endpoints, and the correct endpoint must be used to retrieve the correct CloudWatch metrics.  Reger to the list of  <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region" target="_blank">AWS Regions and Endpoints</a>.  The desired Endpoint should be set as the <em> url</em> property of the Data Source.</p>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>The Amazon CloudWatch API requires authentication using AWS IAM credentials, and signs the HTTP requests using Signature Version 4.  The <em> accessKeyId</em> and<em> secretAccessKey</em> properties are required for this purpose.</p>
