<h3>About</h3>
<p>
  Cyclotron is a browser-based platform for creating dashboards.  
  It provides standard boilerplate and plumbing, allowing non-programmers to easily create 
  and edit dashboards using customizable components.  It has a built-in dashboard editor, 
  and hosts the dashboards directly.
</p>
<p>
  Dashboards are defined declaratively as a JSON document, which contains all the properties 
  required to render the Dashboard. 
</p>
<div ng-repeat="message in selectedItem.messages" class="bg-{{ message.type || info }}"><i ng-class="message.icon || fa-info-circle" class="fa"></i>
  <div data-ng-bind-html="message.html" class="inner"></div>
</div>

  <li><strong>Dashboard</strong>: a series of Pages, as well as Data Sources, Scripts, Styles, and other configurations; stored as a JSON document, it contains all the properties required to render itself</li>

<h4>When Should I Use Cyclotron?</h4>
<p>
  Cyclotron is best thought of as an alternative to custom, light-weight websites that visualize data.  It provides the web hosting,
  page layout, data loading, and assorted widgets&mdash;all without writing code.  In contrast, building a comparable website 
  from scratch would require provisioning a server/VM, choosing the appropriate web frameworks and libraries, and writing 
  the code for the site.  Using Cyclotron simplifies this process dramatically, making it ideal for rapid development and prototyping.
</p>
<p>
  However, Cyclotron implements a limited set of widgets, although the HTML and Javascript widgets do allow for a wide degree
  of customization with some coding.  Cyclotron works best with minimally-interactive dashboards, as it lacks more robust 
  interaction features like dependent widgets and triggers.
</p>
<p>Through various Data Sources, Cyclotron can pull data from databases, web services, etc. It's possible to do light data processing and massaging in Cyclotron, but it is not a replacement for ETL processes or SQL queries. In this regard, Cyclotron is ideal as a front-end for an existing database or web service. Cyclotron does have a very lightweight data backend for storing Dashboard data, but this is not a replacement for databases as it is limited in storage space and lacks any kind of processing.</p>
<p>
  Finally, Cyclotron has automatic page rotation and data-refreshing features, making it well-suited to hosting status boards and monitoring dashboards.  It is less suitable for generating 
  reports (although PDF export is available).
