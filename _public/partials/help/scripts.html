<h3>Scripts</h3>
<p>The<em>scripts</em>property is an optional list of Javascript code to run when the Dashboard is being initialized.
  Each item in the array either points to an externally-hosted Javascript file, or it contains inline Javascript.
  In both cases, the list of scripts will be executed top-down when the dashboard loads.  Specifically, the scripts
  load after the Digital Wall code and vendor files (e.g. jQuery) are loaded, but before any of the Widgets start to render.
</p>
<p>
  This example shows two scripts: the first is an external Javascript library, D3.js.  The second is a fragment of Javascript
  code that uses D3.js to create a color gradient function.  This could be used in a Chart widget to apply a
  gradient color to each point, also shown below:
</p>
<pre class="code">"scripts": [{
    "path": "http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"
}, {
    "text": "colorGradient=d3.scale.linear().domain([0, 500, 1000]).range(['green', 'yellow', 'red']);"
}]
</pre>
<pre class="code">"widgets": [{
    "dataSource": "world-traffic",
    "gridHeight": 1,
    "gridWidth": 1,
    "highchart": {
        "series": [{
            "name": "Countries",
            "point": {
                "color": "${colorGradient(Math.log(parseFloat())/22.3)}",
                "x": "",
                "y": ""
            }
        }]
    },
    "title": "Chart Widget",
    "widget": "chart"
}]
</pre>
<h4>Single-Load</h4>
<p>
  By default, Cyclotron refreshes the Dashboard definition every minute (or every second in Preview mode).  When this happens, Pages,
   Widgets, Styles, and Scripts are updated to keep the Dashboard up-to-date.  Inline Scripts (with a<em> text</em> property) are automatically re-executed.  This is ideal if they contain helper functions or lookup datasets, but can be a problem if
   they perform other actions like loading data.  In this case, the<em> singleLoad</em> property can be set true, so that the Script will only be run once, the first time the Dashboard is opened in the browser.
</p>
<p>Scripts loaded from a<em> path</em> property are always considered single-load scripts and the value of this property will be ignored.</p>
