<h3>Pages</h3>
<p>
  In Cyclotron, Dashboards are composed of Pages.  A Page is a full-screen display of one or more Widgets.  
  Each Dashboard can have one or more Pages.
</p>
<p>To add a Page to a Dashboard, first click on the Pages section of the Dashboard Editor, and click <strong class="no-wrap"><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add Page</strong> at the top of the editor.  Click on the new Page to open its editor.</p>
<p>
  The order of Pages is significant: the first Page will be loaded by default when the Dashboard loads.  Dashboard
  controls allow the user to scroll forwards or backwards through the pages in a linear fashion.  The Pages page 
  allows easy reordering of the list of Pages in the Dashboard.
</p>
<h4>Page Name</h4>
<p>The <em>name </em>is displayed in the URL when viewing this page.  It is optional&mdash;a default name
  will be generated from the page number (e.g.<em> /page-1)</em> if this property is omitted.  If the first page does not have a<em> name</em> , the URL will simply refer to the Dashboard without a page name or number, since the first page is the default.
</p>
<h4>Common Properties</h4>
<p>
  These properties apply to each Page.  Several of them are overrides for Dashboard properties, from which 
  a Page will inherit if the properties are not overridden at the Page level.
