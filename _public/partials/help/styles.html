<h3>Styles</h3>
<p>The <em>styles </em>property is an optional list of CSS styles to apply to the Dashboard.  
  Each item in the array either points to an externally-hosted CSS file, or it contains inline CSS.  
  In both cases, the list of CSS styles will be executed top-down when the dashboard loads.  Specifically, these styles
  applied after the Cyclotron, 3rd-party, and theme styles have been loaded loaded.
</p>
<p>This example shows two styles: the first is an external CSS file, and the second is an inline style:</p>
<pre class="code">"styles": [{
    "path": "http://mrmrs.io/btns/css/btns.min.css"
}, {
    "text": "button.custom-button { color: black !important; }"
}]
</pre>
<h4>Overriding Styles</h4>
<p>
  There are several potential pitfalls to applying custom styles.  Cyclotron comes with several baseline 
  styles and a "CSS Reset", which attempts to normalize styles across all browsers.  On top of this,
  each Dashboard Theme applies additional styles.  Due to <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/css/css-specificity-inheritance-cascaade/">CSS precedence and inheritance</a> rules, it can be
  tricky to correctly override Theme styles with custom styles.
</p>
<p>
  The easiest (and ugliest) solution is generally to add "!important" to the end of each custom style, as this generally trumps
  other styles.  Alternatively, inspect the element to be styled in the browser's developer tools, 
  and write the custom style in a more-specific fashion to trump the theme styles.  Using an ID for a parent DIV is generally effective.
