<h3>Dashboards</h3>
<p>
  In Cyclotron, Dashboards consist of one or more Pages, each of which has one or more Widgets. A Dashboard has 
  several top-level properties, many of which are inherited by Pages and Widgets.  Setting a property at the
  Dashboard-level can be more efficient than setting it directly on every Widget.  Inherited properties can be 
  overridden by the Page and/or Widget, as well.
</p>
<p>In the Dashboard Editor, these properties are found under the Details tab, although <em>pages</em>, <em>dataSources</em>, <em>scripts</em>, etc. are located in their own tab in the Editor.</p>
